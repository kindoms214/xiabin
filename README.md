just like building a new project, I started a new journey.

Hello world
  What a kind words.This is most people write in their first program, although most of them are confused with how the computer do this. So, I write this word in my first github account in a sense. I don't know what I will do with such a open source communication platform, but I'll try my best to do it will.
